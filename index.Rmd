# Why a Code Quality Handbook? {#intro}

The aim of the Code Quality Handbook is to create a handbook, that you can use when you are starting on a project or include in a project you are already on.

Its goal is to provide you with a good overview of what to do in a project and how to do it in order to maximise the quality of your code, and in that regard the project as well.

We want to make sure that your code works every time, under every condition and is written in a way that makes sense to you and to others. Because if it doesnâ€™t, then your code is and project will eventually run in to difficulties.

* If you are doing research with a company then it means doing research that can be reproduced - every time.
* If you are helping a client with their coding in a business setting, then it means writing production ready code. 
* If you are just writing code alone in the dark it means writing code your future self will understand.

The book is a work in progress and will evolve over time as new things get added and as we learn and improve on the different chapters.

> The ambition of this book is quite big: to be a single point of reference when you start a new project.

That means that we will try to cover everything from documentation, coding style to security and even ethics. We want to make good programmers out of good data scientists.

And please contact us if anything is missing from this book.
